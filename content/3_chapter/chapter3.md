# Case study 3: Design of working/living environment 

Author: Yan Wang 

## Project background

This project aims to assess important elements in a combined working/living environment during the pandemic and create customized design for different user groups. This project will adopt a combined participatory approach in data collection and design of working/living environment: 
- Collect social media images of working/living environment, online focus group/survey. 
- Iterative design/evaluation process of the working/living environment via participatory virtual reality (VR) experiment.

## Research data management considerations

### Data collection

- Social media images
- Online focus group session (recording/transcripts)
- VR models and testing results

### Ethics 

- Safety of VR experiment
- Human participation vs (no) personal data

### Privacy 

- Protection of personal data (images, focus group)

### Data sharing _should we have data storage and sharing together for each case study?_

- Public report with visuals 
- Public display of designs (copyrighted)
