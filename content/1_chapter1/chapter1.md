# Case study 1: Living Lab in Katmandu

Author: Yan Wang 

## Project background

<!---
I think not everyone (e.g. me!) knows what a living lab is, so a brief definition would be helpful here.
I tried googling for one but the first one I saw said that people don't necessarily agree :)
So I think it'd be helpful if Yan could add her definition here.

The project aims to create inclusive and resilient dwelling clusters for urban resettlement in Kathmandu (Nepal) and establish a living lab model to develop transparent and integrated methodology of analysis, planning and design.

a definition could go here

This project will:
- Employ a participatory planning and design approach and survey and map social and spatial living patterns of residents from different urban conditions. 

<!--- what is meant by "MSc studio" here?-->

- Support a new MSc studio: Masters students will carry out field research for the project, as part of their study. 
- Collaborate with practitioners: The research outcome will be used as pilot project for local development

## Research data management considerations

### Data collection

Various types of data are collected and processed by the research team. There may be a distinction between the data that will be used for research analysis (research data) and the data that will be for project administration. In this project, the research data includes, for instance, the terrain data (such as drone images, maps, historical land survey and neighbourhood drawings) and the interview data (such as the audio recordings, notes from the researchers and the interview transcripts). The informed consent formsare not research data but, given the personal data contained, require good protection. 

 <!--- I think it should be explicitly mentioned that the informed consents are an example of data used for project administration. The distinction between research and administration data is made very clearly at the beginning of the paragraph - are there any other admin datasets that need to be mentioned here?-->

### Ethics 

The research team carry out their activities in a country outside the European Economic Area (EEA)

<!--- Is the fact that the country is outside the EEA relevant for ethics?-->

. The research team involves the local community by conducting interviews, taking drone pictures, sketching residential buildings and so on. The target population come from traditional neighborhoods, slum and urban resettlement, and include different age groups. Some of the participants may belong to "risk" populations, e.g., given the social-economic status of some groups and the age of children or elderly people involved.

Because the research takes place in a foreign country, specific arrangements must be put in place to guarantee that the interviewees can provide an ``informed'' consent - the researchers must inform the participants about the purpose and the procedure of the data processing as well as the participants' rights in language they understand.

<!--- I wasn't sure if what was meant here was just translations or ensuring that the language is simple enough to be comprehensible. I think both would make sense to be mentioned here :) -->

It may be that participants are not able/willing to sign forms, nor provide their names. The procedure for collecting consent should be outlined and reviewed by the appropriate committee. 

### Privacy 

The research team collects various types of personal data, such as the locations, household compositions, financial information and health conditions and so on. That means that sensitive personal data will be collected and processed. This research data and the outcomes of the research will be shared with the local partners. Because the location of the community is in a country outside the EEA , special arrangements are needed for the data transfer and its protection. 

### Data storage and sharing

All the research data is shared within the project consortium which include international research and industry partners. The research outcome is planned to be shared with the local governmental agencies who will implement the design into concrete construction projects. Students will join the research team in working with the local community and contribute to the research data processing. 

## Solutions and advice

The following has been proposed to the research team to ensure good data management throughout the project lifecycle.

### Data storage and sharing

- Choose a secure storage location that is accessible by external partners. 
- Access control should be designed and implemented to access different types of project data. For instance, limiting the number of partners accessing the sensitive data, separating the storage of the informed consent forms. 
- The interview data is to be collected by the research team, but only aggregated information would be shared beyond the initial core team. 
- Presenting the research outputs in the project website/blog with open and closed communication channel

### Legal 

A few legal issues deserve the attention from the research team:
- The students own their work by default if the idea or creative decision making come from themselves. Therefore it is important to check and clarify the ownership of student design when including them into the project. 
- The project outcome (neighbourhood design) is planned to be transformed into a pilot construction project at the local community. The Intelletcual Property Rights (IPR) of design should be specified in advance and agreed by the project consortium. 

## Advice (process)

- Consult data steward about secure data storage options and data sharing protocols
- Apply ethics approval and prepare informed consent form for conducting the interviews
- Check with privacy advisor for advice on protecting sensitive personal data
- Check with legal advisor and contract manager regarding including student work in research project. If necessary, ask students to agreeing on including their work in research project.
