# Case study 1: Living Lab in Katmandu

Author: Yan Wang 

## Project background


The project aims to create inclusive and resilient dwelling clusters for urban resettlement in Kathmandu (Nepal) and establish a living lab model to develop transparent and integrated methodology of analysis, planning and design. In this context, the experimental setup is considered as a "living lab" as it involves continuous inputs from citizens in the project, both for the definitions of the problems, as well as in the evaluation of solutions.


This project will:
- Employ a participatory planning and design approach and survey and map social and spatial living patterns of residents from different urban conditions. 
- Support integration of MSc students in the projects: Masters students will carry out field research for the project, as part of their study. 
- Collaborate with practitioners: The research outcome will be used as pilot project for local development

## Research data management considerations

### Data collection

Various types of data are collected and processed by the research team. There may be a distinction between the data that will be used for research analysis (research data) and the data that will be for project administration. 

In this project, the research data includes, for instance, the terrain data (such as drone images, maps, historical land survey and neighbourhood drawings) and the interview data (such as the audio recordings, notes from the researchers and the interview transcripts). 

Project data will contain all contracts and agreements between the research team and the local administrations. This includes the agreements between the research team and the local citizens, through the use of consent form. The informed consent forms are not research data but, given the personal data contained, require good protection. 


### Ethics 

The research team carry out their activities in a country outside the European Economic Area (EEA). 

The research team involves the local community by conducting interviews, taking drone pictures, sketching residential buildings and so on. The target population come from traditional neighborhoods, slum and urban resettlement, and include different age groups. Some of the participants may belong to "risk" populations, e.g., given the social-economic status of some groups and the age of children or elderly people involved. Specific attention must be given to protect the anonimity of the participant (when possible, requested, or suggested). A local representative may not have any concern regarding his/her anonimity, but an average citizen may. 

Because the research takes place in a foreign country, specific arrangements must be put in place to guarantee that the interviewees can provide an ``informed'' consent - the researchers must inform the participants about the purpose and the procedure of the data processing as well as the participants' rights in language they understand. This include an effort to translate the document, and ensure that the language used in the form is clear of the intended participants.

It may be that participants are not able/willing to sign forms, nor provide their names. The procedure for collecting consent should be outlined and reviewed by the appropriate committee. 

### Privacy 

The research team collects various types of personal data, such as the locations, household compositions, financial information and health conditions and so on. That means that sensitive personal data will be collected and processed. This research data and the outcomes of the research will be shared with the local partners. Because the location of the community is in a country outside the EEA , special arrangements are needed for the data transfer and its protection. 

### Data storage and sharing

All the research data is shared within the project consortium which include international research and industry partners. The research outcome is planned to be shared with the local governmental agencies who will implement the design into concrete construction projects. Students will join the research team in working with the local community and contribute to the research data processing. 

There will be several level of data sharing: among the research team, with the local government, and with consortium partners. It is expected that the research outcome will be shared with everyone, but raw data (interview/personal information) does not need to be shared beyond the study team.

Field work in remote areas come with its own challenes, we cannot expect the on-site teams to advice constant and reliable internet connections. We have to consider how the information will be collected on the ground first, and how it gets saved as a separate step.

## Solutions and advice

The following has been proposed to the research team to ensure good data management throughout the project lifecycle.

### Data storage and sharing

- Choose a secure storage location that is accessible by external partners. 
- Access control should be designed and implemented to access different types of project data. For instance, limiting the number of partners accessing the sensitive data, separating the storage of the informed consent forms. 
- The interview data is to be collected by the research team, but only aggregated information would be shared beyond the initial core team. The core team must have the means to record interviews, using dedicated devices, and safely upload the data in the team data storage (which must be accessible from the outside). Cloud storage, provided it is approved by the research institution for personally identifiable data, will be sufficient. The research team must have the ability to setup access rights on their own (to accomodate for MSc students joining and leaving the team).
- Presenting the research outputs in the project website/blog with open and closed communication channel

### Legal 

A few legal issues deserve the attention from the research team:
- The students own their work by default if the idea or creative decision making come from themselves. Therefore it is important to check and clarify the ownership of student design when including them into the project. 
- The project outcome (neighbourhood design) is planned to be transformed into a pilot construction project at the local community. The Intelletcual Property Rights (IPR) of design should be specified in advance and agreed by the project consortium. 

## Advice (process)

- Consult data steward about secure data storage options and data sharing protocols
 - personally identifiable information must be handled with care
 - access rights must be manageable by the team   
- Apply ethics approval and prepare informed consent form for conducting the interviews
 - provide an readable version of the Ethics commitee (not in a foreign language), and ensure you can produce the consent form in the right language. 
- Check with privacy advisor for advice on protecting sensitive personal data
 - given the sentivity of the collected information, a review was deemed necessary.
- Check with legal advisor and contract manager regarding including student work in research project. If necessary, ask students to agreeing on including their work in research project.
