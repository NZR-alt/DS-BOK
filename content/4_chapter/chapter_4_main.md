# Case study 4 : Master thesis work, interview in a company

Author: Nicolas Dintzner 

## Project background

A master student is doing an internship within a large consultancy company. The function held by the student involves a number of meetings with employees of that company, as well as meeting with prospective customers, or members of partner organizations. 

The master thesis the student is working on is tightly linked to his professional activities, and involves gathering infomration from the aforementioned meetings. The student is supervised by both the company and the university.

The student mostly participates in meetings organized by his company supervisors. He may organize additional ones, to gather more specific information from participants. 

## Research data management considerations

### Data collection

This study involves collecting interview and panel group information. This may involve recording, but in this case, only meeting notes, minutes, and summaries are produced from the meeting. The data does not need to contain personal information, but the student will have to keep lists of names and person he/she talked to during the research. 

### Ethics 

Because the collected information will be, in some format, be made publicly available, the participants should be fully aware that their contribution will be made public. 
However, because everything happens in a profesisional environment, there are no particular worries regarding the vulnerability of the participants.

### Privacy 

The information collected during the experiment is mostly focus on internal processes, and not sensitive personal information. 

The student is supervised internally, and the company's supervisors will have access to what the student intends to publish. There are therefore little concerns regarding the confidentiality of the data itself. 

The anonimity of the participants, promised by the MS student, may be challenging to reach. The student must pay attention to how he refers to the different participants of the meetings. The company in which he does his internship will be known, and as such, it facilitate re-identifications of the meeting participants. 

### Data sharing _are there any storage implications?_

In this instance, it was decide that all personal data collected was to be performed within the company. The student would share anonymized summaries of meeting with their university supervisors, hence limiting personal data transfer. 

Confidential (technical) information given to the student by the company was made available to the university supervisor through a corporate solution (suitable for them). 

## Solutions & advices

### Data storage

Given that the student will work most of his time inside the company, and that the data used for the thesis is also company documents, the storage solution of the company was deemed sufficient. 

A storage solution, within the university, was made available to the student and the supervisors (all of them), ensuring that the most relevant information for the MSc thesis work was accessible to all relevant people. It was left to the student to ensure that this shared storage contained the right documents.

### Legal 

The student's work contract can be of use when determining intellectual property rights on the data created during the project. However, in this case, everyone agreed that most of the collected information was going to be confidential (commercially sensitive). 

## Advice (process)

Because the summary of the transcripts would be published, it is necessary to follow the internal university protocols regarding personal data management. 
Despite participating in meeting organized by the company, the student was requested to create consent forms, informing participants what would happen to the data they provide (public archival), and who would have access to it (both the university _and_ the company supervisor)

In this instance, the most important thing was to ensure that consent was granted for publication of the interview summaries, with approval from the host company.
