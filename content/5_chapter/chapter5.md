# Case study 5: MSc student thesis: A commercial internship project involving personal data collection 

Author: Nicolas Dintzner

## Project background

A MSc student is studying the barrier to the adoption of low carbon technologies in the domain of banking industry. 

In partnership with a large national bank, in which the student is performing his internship, the student will interview partners and customers of that bank, to gather their input on how they see the bank apply such technologies. 

The bank, hosting the student, is very active in this domain and the student is assisting them in their endeavour.

The student, with his company supervisor will run several interviews and focus groups in order to identify barriers and challenges they may face when attempting to implement low carbon solution and satisfy their customers. 

The work takes place of 6 months.

In this instance, while the work is performed by a MSc student, there are no specific plans to follow up with a scientific publication. 
The thesis contains a specific application of known techniques in a specific context, and is more _engineering_ than _research_.

## Research data management considerations

### Data collection and storage

The data collection will be performed jointly by the MSc student and his company supervisor, with potentially more employees of the bank assisting in the focus group sessions. 

From each event, a collection of notes will be taken  (text files) , and summary reports will be produced (text and diagrams). At the end, a global report is provided to the bank, giving them a global overview of the challenges ahead. No audio nor video recording are expected. 

All data collected during focus group sessions and interviews are stored on the bank's internal storage solutions, and the student will follow all the rules, regulations and recommendation associated with data management issued by his hosting company. 

The student will have a storage at the university as well, which will contain all data that the bank agrees to share with the supervisory team of the student at the University. The student will be in charge on putting the right data in that folder. No personally identifiable information should be stored in that storage, and confidential documents should be labelled as such (to avoid issues on the university side). 

### Ethics

The data collection is happening completely on the side of the bank - regardless of any ethic review. However, since the work of the student will result in a Master Thesis, published under the name of the university, a review is still necessary. 

As always, it is preferable to have consent documents. If consent documents are used, the student can keep a copy of the document and present them to the university Ethic's review team. 

If no consent documents documents are used, then it is assumed that the content of the MSc thesis - which is likely going to be public and must be reviewed by the bank, does not jeopardize their relationship of the bank with its customers/partners. 
In any case, the information given by participants to the bank, and thus to the master student, will fall under pre-existing agreement such as NDAs or other bank/customer relationship agreement. Documents indicating that the student is aware of such constrains can be provided to the ethics team.

### Privacy and legal aspects

The bank is engaged in the exploratory study of barriers to adoption of low carbon energy, and is trying to assess what its customer/partners want in such transition. Because the work will be done with or without the MSc student, and personal data will be collected for this purpose by the bank, it is reasonable to consider that the bank is responsible for the personal data processing in this context. 

The student will have to stricly abide by the agreements between the bank and its partners/customers. 

To evaluate the work of the student, the university supervisor does not need access to personal information of the participants. It is agreed that all personal data will remain in the bank. This solution alleviate the need for data sharing agreement between the university and the bank. 

Personal data should not be shared with the university, and cannot be used in the final MSc thesis. 

## Advice (process)

- Check who needs access to personal data. If access is not required for the tasks at hand, consider limiting the access to it to avoid the need for data sharing agreements.
- Participants must still be informed that their input will be a contribution to a MSc thesis (it's a public document!)
- Consent documents may not be common practice in company settings, but their use is critical for research. Consider discussing this early on when students are working with personal data in company setting.
